# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
Generate, preprocess, and explore a DataFrame by merging data from City Bikes, Foursquare, and Yelp sources. Develop a regression model and provide business-oriented recommendations based on the analysis.

## Process
### step 1:Connecting to CityBikes API
### step 2:Connecting to Foursquare and Yelp
### step 3:Combining (stacking) yelp and foursquare dataframes with further merging with bike_df. Data visualisations. Creation of database combined_data.db.
### step 4:Build a regression model that demonstrates a relationship between the number of bikes in a particular location and the characteristics of the restaurant location (distance from bike station).

## Results
R=0.006 in linear regression model means that relationship between 'Distances' and 'Free Bikes' is weak.

## Challenges 
Connecting to API, figuring out mess gotten from API, lack of knowledge, lack of time

## Future Goals
Spend much less time on data collecting and cleaning to have more time for data analysis and interpretation
